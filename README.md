# wprs-api

A PHP library to scrape data from the FAI CIVL [World Ranking System (WPRS)][wprs]

## Installation

Install the latest version with:

```bash
$ composer require wprs/api
```

## Requirements

* PHP 7.4 minimum, although using the latest PHP version is highly recommended.

## About

The original [WPRS][wprs-original] stopped receiving updates when a new system was introduced in
2021. Despite hopes that a basic API (at minimum) would be provided, this did not happen.

This library provides an API for page-scraping the new web site and it is hoped that it may lead to
a proper API in the future.

## Usage
Full usage information is available in the [documentation][docs].
